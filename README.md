Followed instructions here: https://www.geekinsydney.com/4678/adventures-python-programming-minecraft-first-steps/

Had to go searching for craftbukkit but found it here: https://yivesmirror.com/downloads/craftbukkit

This package is also required: https://github.com/dranjan/python-plyfile
Can be installed with pip install plyfile

Didn't require moving to python 2.6. 2.7 was fine.

recommended server.properties for craftbukkit included
